## The Purpose, Cause & Believes

We believe life has become overwhelming by what it has to offer.
Human can easily lost himself in this ocean of possibilities.
We believe human can be easily trapped in a uncontrolled life, living someone else's life.
Being drived by companies that want our attention but not our interests.
Companies fight for our attention, suggesting how we should use our time & money (eg: Netflix, Amazon, etc...).
We accept these suggestion because they are easy to commit to and promise some fun, but it's not in our long-term interest.
To learn more, Tristan Harris's talks about the subjects are very interesting.
Our purpose is to help human be the version of themself they want to be, living a life without regrets
Helping people do what they trully want.

## The Goals

When we design a product, our goal is to make it accessile to the greatest. To design it in the least intrusive way, and super easy to use. Because we don't want people to consume their time on our products. It has to be like a watch or a calendar. To handle the wide complexity of human life, our products are open to contribution, and able to promote content from community. Resources are always available for those who want to contribute.

## The Solutions

Our first solution is suggesting how people should use their resources, step-by-step, based on the direction they want. It's like combining a GPS with a planning.
