## The Purpose, Cause & Believes

We believe life has become overwhelming by what it has to offer.
Human can easily lost himself in this ocean of possibilities.
We believe human can be easily trapped in a uncontrolled life, living someone else's life.
Being drived by companies that want our attention but not our interests.
Companies fight for our attention, suggesting how we should use our time & money (eg: Netflix, Amazon, Valve, etc...).
We accept these suggestion because they are easy to commit to and promise some fun, but it's not necessarily in our long-term interest.
To learn more, Tristan Harris's talks about the subjects are very interesting.
Our purpose is to help human be the version of themself they want to be, living a life without regrets
Helping people do what they trully want.

## The Goals

When we design a product, our goal is to make it accessile to the greatest. To design it in the least intrusive way, and super easy to use. Because we don't want people to consume their time on our products. It has to be like a watch or a calendar. To handle the wide complexity of human life, our products are open to contribution, and able to promote content from community. Resources are always available for those who want to contribute.

## The Solutions

Our first solution is suggesting how people should use their resources, step-by-step, based on the direction they want. It's like combining a GPS with a planning. And like a GPS, it adapts immediately: if you'r late, if you have an unexpected event, if you'r not in the mood...Your planning will be re-generated.
But because your time is valuable, it will not ask you all the details about when a task should be performed, with what conditions and dependencies or how it should be done. Instead, you will be able constitute your own ministry of expert that will do all this labor. And you are the one giving directions to this ministry. These experts will give the system all it needs to generate your planning. And they should be able to give you additional insight based on your directions.
