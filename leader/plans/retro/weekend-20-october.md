# Friday evening:
  - cinema
  - restaurant

# Saturday:
  - appartment visit (14h)
  - Nox (16h -> 02h)

# Sunday:
  - errands
  - movie while eating
  - side project
  - appartment plan reproduction & laying out
  - tutorials on DIY for the house
  - cooking (18h30)
  - gaming
  - reading

# What goes wrong
  - leaving too late from Nox -> not enough sleep + shift night cycle
  - not enought side-project

# How to improve
  - define a maximal time to leave. Let other know about it. What would be a good time ?
  - wake up earlier the sunday, don't watch a full movie while eating, prepare food later. Replace late gaming by more reading. Do errands on week-day.
